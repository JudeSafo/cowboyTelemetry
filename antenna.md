# Antenna / Radio Module 
While the antenna obviously isn't a piece of code to work, it would still be a good idea to keep a written record of our thoughts.

## Questions
We have some questions for Dr. Green about antenna design listed here. Some background clarification will be listed below.
- How do we design a better antenna?
  - How much flexibility is there with a fixed 915 Mhz frequency?
    - Can we make it longer / does that help?
    - Can we change the shape / does that help?
  - Can we make the rocket antenna somewhat directional (i.e not send signals into the middle of the rocket were that energy will just be lost)?
  - How much does having a directional ground antenna help?
  - Would it possible and worthwile to amplify the signal?

- Other radio module options if nothing would work for this?

Essentially our problem is that our radio module product page only promises 2km under ideal conditions while we would like to achieve ideally probably something like 10k. They did say that has been achieved, but under very ideal conditions and directional antennas.
