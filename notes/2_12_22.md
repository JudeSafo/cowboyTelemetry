The goal for this day was to create the CAD for the ground station and 1U Cubesat to go the rocket. For the ground station, a fair bit of tribulation trying to decide a good way to mount the feather into the ground station, as it turns out that feathers have slightly different sized holes on each side of the board. Additionally, both short sides of the feather needed to be free to allow for the usb port and the antenna/antenna connection. Eventually, it was decided to leave holes to press fit the pin headers through, securing it that way. This works as the ground station will not undergo any significant forces, but would not be suitable in the rocket. A standard 16x2 character LCD was decided to be added to the ground station mount to allow for displaying info recieived by the radio. A battery slot was also made in order to allow the ground station to be carried easily.
