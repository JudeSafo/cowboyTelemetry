This day was meant to be wiring up the ground station with the 3D-printed model. However, several errors were encountered. First, the ground station box was a little shallow, causing the electronics to be a tight fit above the battery. Second, the LCD mount was accidently mirrored, causing it to not fit the actual lcd. Third, the LCD model is a 5V model, while the feather runs on 3.3V logic. This resulted in achieving none of the stated objectives, and instead needing to remodel the CAD.
