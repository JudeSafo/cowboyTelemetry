# 2_5_2022 Radio Testing

The radios were hooked up and testing was done to see the range. Starting with them right next to each other, the radios were brought farther apart until the range was not enough. This resulted in a range of .33 miles or 1742 ft. It is to be noted that default settings were used and we were shooting through a bit of ground and people, and cars could be interfering. Nevertheless, a directional antenna would be helpful, and investigating the use of ham radio frequencies.
