# Notes Overview

This folder will be used to store notes about how the project is coming along. Hopefully this will prototype future documentation efforts by the team. The goal with these notes that we could hand someone who had not interacted with the payload development at all and they would be able to recreate the project. To do this notes will be taken corresponding to whenever work is done in group. Because we did not really do this before 2022 Spring, A "before.md" has been created that should at least fill in the gaps, although truly capturing all the info from the 2021 fall semester is likely impossible.
